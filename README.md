"Customer Segmentation Analysis for Mall Marketing Strategy: Uncovering Patterns and Insights using DBSCAN Clustering"
# This project aimed to perform customer segmentation analysis in a mall setting using the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. By leveraging this density-based clustering technique, we were able to uncover valuable patterns and insights to inform and enhance the mall's marketing strategy.
